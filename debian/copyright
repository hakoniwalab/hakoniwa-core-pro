 Original version by James Carlson
 .
 This implementation of EAP supports MD5-Challenge and SRP-SHA1
 authentication styles.  Note that support of MD5-Challenge is a
 requirement of RFC 2284, and that it's essentially just a
 reimplementation of regular RFC 1994 CHAP using EAP messages.
 .
 As an authenticator ("server"), there are multiple phases for each
 style.  In the first phase of each style, the unauthenticated peer
 name is queried using the EAP Identity request type.  If the
 "remotename" option is used, then this phase is skipped, because
 the peer's name is presumed to be known.
 .
 For MD5-Challenge, there are two phases, and the second phase
 consists of sending the challenge itself and handling the
 associated response.
 .
 For SRP-SHA1, there are four phases.  The second sends 's', 'N',
 and 'g'.  The reply contains 'A'.  The third sends 'B', and the
 reply contains 'M1'.  The forth sends the 'M2' value.
 .
 As an authenticatee ("client"), there's just a single phase --
 responding to the queries generated by the peer.  EAP is an
 authenticator-driven protocol.
 .
 Based on draft-ietf-pppext-eap-srp-03.txt.

 Modifications by Lauri Pesonen / lpesonen@clinet.fi, april 1997
 .
 Implemented LANManager type password response to MS-CHAP challenges.
 Now pppd provides both NT style and LANMan style blocks, and the
 prefered is set by option "ms-lanman". Default is to use NT.
 The hash text (StdText) was taken from Win95 RASAPI32.DLL.
 .
 You should also use DOMAIN\\USERNAME as described in README.MSCHAP80
 .
 Modifications by Frank Cusack, frank@google.com, March 2002.
 .
 Implemented MS-CHAPv2 functionality, heavily based on sample
 implementation in RFC 2759.  Implemented MPPE functionality,
 heavily based on sample implementation in RFC 3079.

 @defgroup bridgeif IEEE 802.1D bridge
 @ingroup netifs
 This file implements an IEEE 802.1D bridge by using a multilayer netif approach
 (one hardware-independent netif for the bridge that uses hardware netifs for its ports).
 On transmit, the bridge selects the outgoing port(s).
 On receive, the port netif calls into the bridge (via its netif->input function) and
 the bridge selects the port(s) (and/or its netif->input function) to pass the received pbuf to.

 SNMPv2c and SNMPv3 compatible agent\n
 There is also a MIB compiler and a MIB viewer in lwIP contrib repository
 (lwip-contrib/apps/LwipMibCompiler).\n
 The agent implements the most important MIB2 MIBs including IPv6 support
 (interfaces, UDP, TCP, SNMP, ICMP, SYSTEM). IP MIB is an older version
 without IPv6 statistics (TODO).\n

 .
 @defgroup rfc7668if 6LoWPAN over BLE (RFC7668)
 @ingroup netifs
 This file implements a RFC7668 implementation for 6LoWPAN over
 Bluetooth Low Energy. The specification is very similar to 6LoWPAN,
 so most of the code is re-used.
 Compared to 6LoWPAN, much functionality is already implemented in
 lower BLE layers (fragmenting, session management,...).
